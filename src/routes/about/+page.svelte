			The physical space that we call 1RG is built on the traditional territory of many nations
			including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and
			the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis peoples.
			This land is covered by Treaty 13 with the Mississaugas of the Credit.
		</p>

		<p>
			Our 1RG community is made up of settlers, immigrants and descendants of immigrants and as
			such, we recognize the sustained intergenerational trauma and continued colonial violence
			against Indigenous peoples, including food insecurity, police brutality, residential school
			denialism and climate change. We recognize that we have ongoing work to continue to learn
			about our own colonial past and unlearn racist and oppressive behaviors, and to interrupt
			these behaviors by others whenever and however we can.
		</p>

		<p>
			We recognize that our efforts are imperfect, and that we participate in and benefit from the
			ongoing harm of colonization and are committed to an ongoing process of learning.
		</p>

		<p>We offer these words in humility, and welcome feedback and critique.</p>
